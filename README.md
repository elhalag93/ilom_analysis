# ilom_analysis
oracle hardware log ilom analysis via python script
iloms is the script looking for logs in path 'D:\pm_analysis\iloms\logs' to put the analysis under path 'D:\pm_analysis\iloms\analysis'  and the summary of analysis under path 'D:\pm_analysis\iloms\summary'

make sure you create those 3 paths 
1-'D:\pm_analysis\iloms\summary'
2-'D:\pm_analysis\iloms\analysis'
3-'D:\pm_analysis\iloms\logs'
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
copy all ilom logs you need to check under 'D:\pm_analysis\iloms\logs'
then run the iloms.py script 
you will find the important files to check under 'D:\pm_analysis\iloms\analysis' 
and result for searhing for faulty parts and errors under 'D:\pm_analysis\iloms\summary'
